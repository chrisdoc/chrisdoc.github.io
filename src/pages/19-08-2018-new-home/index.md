Oooooh-weeee, my first blog post!

Well there is a first for everything and after 29 years I finally gave in and created a blog.

This blog will mostly be centered arounding coding, traveling and cooking. I enjoy traveling and I have lived in 6 cities adn 4 different countries across Europe. From Austria to Finland over Germany and now in The Netherlands.
